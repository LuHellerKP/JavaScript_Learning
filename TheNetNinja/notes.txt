#2 - Creating a React Application
Setup and explanation of some files and components;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#3 - Components and Templates
Components:
    Building blocks/ beating heart of any react app;
    One app has several different component, and each component is a self-contained section of content;
    Constains:
        Their own templates;
        Their own logic;
    It is a function and we always must return something inside that function, and generally that is going to be a jsx template;

JSX:
    Allow us to create some html style templates and components;
    className == class;

At the end of the App.js file we always export our component function so that we can use it in other files;
Inside 'index.js' we import the 'App' component and use it inside the rendering;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#4 - Dynamic Values in Templates
You can't output booleans and objects;
Use the Dynamic Values as attribute values in element tags;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#5 - Multiple Components
Component Tree:
    Root component;
    Nesting components;
'sfc' + 'tab' == creates a stateless functional component
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#6 - Adding Styles
Copy Paste the styles from github
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#7 - Click Events
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#8 - Using State (useState hook)/#9 - Intro to React Dev Tools 
State of a component --> data being used in that component at that point in time;
Hook:
    Special type of function that does a certain job;
    Starts with the word use;
    Ex.: useState
        Gives a way to make a reactive value and also provides us with a way to change that value whenever we want 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#10 - Outputting Lists
Map Method:
    Cycles through an array and it can do something with each item in the array
    Ex.: We want to return a bit of template for each item as we iterate through each one and then that template is going to be output to the browser;
        For each iteration, as we cycle through these we get access to the item we're currently iterating.
Key property:
    React uses to keep track of each item in the DOM as it outputs it;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#11 - Props
It's a way to pass data from one component (parent) into a child component;
Advantages:
    Makes the component more reusable;
    Allows to use the data in the preview component later;
